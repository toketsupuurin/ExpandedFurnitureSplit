Mod Overview --------------------------------------------[MO]

This is a content pack for the Expanded Furniture Mod. This will not function without it. You can find the base mod here:

This pack adds Groovy set content.

For more details about the mod, including update notes see the main mod readme. This file probably won't be updated.

Permissions -----------------------------------------------[PM]

Any assets I've created (basically anything in this mod barring simple corrections) do not require permission to use or change, barring any limitations on game assets themselves by the devs. Just don't take them wholecloth and call them yours. Credit is not required but appreciated. 

Dock files, AutoTile data, Patch Systems, or any Bone Animations in particular are shared freely with the community in the hopes that more people make awesome things.

IN PARTICULAR: PLEASE DO STEAL AND USE THE "VanillaTotemPatches" FOLDER FOR USE IN YOUR OWN MODS AND USE THE TAGS MENTIONED IN THE MODDING SECTION. I don't require credit. Widespread community adoption of standards everyone can use is much more important to me than credit.

If you want to do any edits to the rainbow furniture in particular I recommend starting with the Grey set as your base. the colors are easiest to see there and the base color of the furniture doesn't conflict with the stripes.

Change History --------------------------------------------[CH]
