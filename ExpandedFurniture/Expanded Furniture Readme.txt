Mod Overview --------------------------------------------[MO]

As of 3.0: Expanded Furniture has gotten so large it's causing issues for a lot of people. So I've chopped it up. This is the base mod. It has the pet furniture set, all bookshelves, and all wall shelves. It also has totem patches and catalog patches and other such stuff. EVERYTHING ELSE has been broken out into content packs. You can pick and choose what sets you want so you won't be wasting space or resources on sets you don't like. Some content packs will be dependent on the base mod, but a few won't. Occasionally a mod will require more than one pack. Steam will have notifications on requirements.

Expanded Furniture seeks to provide you with a full array of decorating options. You no longer have to ask yourself "Why does X Set not have Y piece of furniture like Contemporary does?" Or "Why is the only decent storage shelf only available in basic brown?" Now that that's done I'm moving onto other pieces of decor that need fleshing out or tweaking like kitchens, bathrooms and exterior pieces like doors and windows. Most (but not all) of the villagers have tables to give you as a reward. I also intend to eventually flesh each of those tables out into their own sets, as well, so you can create a house that feels utterly perfect for each villager. (Vorlen, Rowan, Max and Leif do not have reward tables. I may eventually invent something for them wholecloth.)

Additionally: Any art in the original game that has an error I come across is also included. I can't patch these in currently because of engine limitations, but you can manually add the corrected files to the game via instructions later on in this file. (See: [CA].)

Packs: If You Don't Like Something In This Mod-----------[DL]

	Expanded Furniture is now completely modular. All furniture sets are now contained in expansion packs. If you don't like a set just don't subscribe/install it! There is no code in this mod, so feel free to remove things you don't like. (I don't care how you decide to enjoy my work.) 

	DO NOT DELETE the ConfigsDocks folder unless you're completely removing the mod! Nearly every furniture set depends on something in that folder.

	The Wacky Pack includes:

		AlienEgg - an easter egg for you to discover. Baa.
		CookieBlocks - Gingerbread themed building blocks to make a gingerbread house.
			Cookie House (Requires Cookie Blocks and Spooky Pack) - upon creation of a new world there's a chance a Witch and/or Santa house will spawn in your world.
		PizzaBlocks - A cheese pizza floor and giant toppings.

	Spoiler Packs include:
	
		Black Metal - Aliza's set. If you have her table then you're fine.
		Darkwood - This is only technically a spoiler. You can purchase parts of this set from an airship merchant.
		Nerdy - Jamie's set. This will have spoilers all the way up to Jamie's final quest.
		Mushroom - If you have Morel then you're fine.
		Antique - If you've gotten to the new island available after Leif's bestie quest then you're fine.

	Special Packs include:

		Rainbow - The rainbow set is enormous. I've packaged all the variations together. I highly recommend picking only the ones you like and deleting the other folders.
		Roof - NOT DEPENDENT. Adds new roof tiles and two new slopes. Enormous. Organized by folders. Again, I recommend you delete any colors you don't care for.
		Lighting Edition - This is NOT DEPENDENT on the base mod. It has stand alone copies of all the lamps for people who just want lamps. If you've installed all the packs then don't install this, it's redundant.
	
	Changes the base mod makes:

		Catalog Patches - Adds selected vanilla items to the catalog. If they aren't reachable in the base game they're just active by default. If they're in vanilla you'll have to find and inspect them with a magnifying glass/obtain them once.
		Pet Patches - These should just work, but if they change gameplay in a way you don't like you can delete the folder.
			Species Unique Drops - Each pet will only drop the futon it likes. Delete if you want all pets to drop all possible stuff.
			Remove Pet Furniture From Catalog - Vanilla allows pet furniture in the catalog. This prevents it from being there. 
			Pet Store Pet Furniture Shelf - Adds a fourth shelf to the pet store that sells pet furniture.
		Vanilla Price Patches - Fixes the prices on a few pieces of furniture to match the set. See 2.4 patch notes. Delete this if you want wonky Vanilla prices.
		Vanilla Totem Patches - Genericizes most vanilla totems to accept EF furniture (or properly categorized furniture from other mods). Auto detects Automagic and prevents these changes from affecting the building store.
		

Road Map -----------------------------------------------[RM]

COLLECTION 1: The Standard Sets (FINISHED)--------------[C1]

	There are 16 primary styles of furniture decor in the game (not counting kitchens, bathrooms, the office furniture set, exterior objects, and two sparse restaurant sets) You can buy these at the shops, traders, or the airship merchant.
	All 16 sets now have a full compliment of furniture, along with whatever extra bits suited my fancy. I only filled in holes, so some sets got more pieces than others. 

	The full list of furniture types that each set has:
		Armchair
		Bookshelf
		Chair
		Coffee Table (Normal and No Dock)
		Credenza
		Desk (Normal and No Dock)
		Double Bed (Normal and No Dock)
		Dresser
		Foot Lamp (Torchiere Lamps)
		Futon (This isn't a Futon! It's a Chaise Longue.)
		2 Lamps (Candles and torches don't count for this.)
		Long Stool (It's an Ottoman.)
		Loveseat
		Side Table (Normal and No Dock)
		Single Bed (Normal and No Dock)
		Sofa
		Stool
		Table
		Table Large
		TV Stand
		Vanity
		Wall Lamp
		Wardrobe Single
		Wardrobe Double
		Candles (I'm also counting torches.)
		Shelf (Called "Wall Mounted Dock" in the files.)
		Ceiling Lamp
		Chandelier (3x3 or bigger)

Any set declared done has all of these pieces. Other pieces may be made as I think of them or as they seem appropriate.

The remaining Collections will not be done in any sort of order. 

COLLECTION 2: The Reward Sets (30%)--------------------[C2]

	Certain characters give you unique pieces of furniture as quest rewards. Reward Sets are intended to flesh those pieces into full sets that are appropriately themed. These can be visually a bit spoilery. These sets will never include the precise piece given as a reward. You still have to earn that yourself.
	
	Completed Sets : 3/10
		* Darkwood Set (Yes, Really. Emilia was supposed to give this as a reward once upon a time. Now it's sold by the airship Merchant instead.)
		* Nerdy Set (Also includes any cool quest items that made awesome decor.)
		* Black Metal Set (Alicia's set. The table just screamed Charles Rennie Makintosh to me and was what made me start this mod in the first place. Every item in the set is a Staxeled interpretation of one of his pieces or an extrapolation thereof.)

COLLECTION 3: The Other Sets (??%)---------------------[C3]

	This is sort of a catch all and might get subdivided.
	* There are currently 2 Restaurant sets in the game that need expanding. These will focus on dining furniture: booth benches, counters, 2 tops, 4 tops, chairs, stools, bars, lamps, candles. 
		*Restaurant (Airship Merchant)
		*Tavern
	* Kitchens: There are 2-4 Kitchen sets in the game depending on how I count.
		* Domestic
		* Restaurant
		* Patisserie (might fall under restaurant, I haven't studied the pieces yet.)
		* Pizza (There's only an oven here. I lean toward calling this a decorative piece in the Restaurant set.)
	* Bathrooms: (IN PROGRESS) There is one bathroom set in the entire game. This won't stand. Work has begun on the bathroom pieces. They've been separated into their respective mod sets. I'm undecided on just how many sets I'll make, and if I'll make a unique one for all 25 sets. I do plan to at least make sure there's something suitable for each set, but some might share. If I decide a bathroom can be shared I'll make a note of that.
	* Office: These are more commercial offices than home offices, but I want to do at least 1 more set of higher end office furniture that feels more coherent.
	* Museum Displays: Most of them are fine, there needs to be some wall mounting options, though, along with some more variety in the modern displays.
	* Exteriors: There's lots of stuff here. Each of the 25 sets really needs to have exterior pieces and trim that fit them. Very little actually suits most sets.
		* Roofs: (2:1 and 1:2 slopes done.) Ridgeline blocks are still eventually planned. 2:1 slopes are called TAO (Two Above One) blocks and 1:2 are OAT (One Above Two). Each of these blocks has a "base" end for the fat bit, and a "tip" end for the skinny bit. They should be applied in alternating layers. TAO blocks can be troublesome if you try you build down. For best results, build bottom up with TAO blocks. I've looked at Diagonal Roofs. They're possible, but will be even more complicated and horrible than the TAO and OAT blocks. If I ever make these I will likely split them into their own mod. Don't hold your breath. They'd be an utter misery to use.
		* Stairs: Frankly, I feel like I could just say "use roofs" and call it a day, but actual stair pieces that suit trim sets could look pretty sharp.
		* Doors & Door Frames: Loads of variety and yet I never find one that fits like I want it to. There will be many.
		* Windows & Window Frames: Ranch is the only set that got any attention here. All the others need to come up to snuff. Also: "transparent" glass windows for when you want to enjoy the view. I'll have to do research into other mods to see what's been done.
		* Shutters: You can't have a creepy house or a stately manor without appropriate shutters. Some sets may not have these. (Minimalist and Contemporary come to mind...)
		* Fences: (DONE) I've regularized all the sets with standard tile options. The single sided picket fence will be left alone (There's no reasonable way to give it T or cross sections.) There are variations for each that tie into the original fences cleanly.
		* Festival: (DONE) The festival set has fountains and the Torii arch. I've also made lantern variations and one of the town arbors so you can have some on your farm without breaking the town.

PHASE 4: I Let My Imagination Go Nuts --------------------[C4]
	
	Sometimes I just get inspired and have to run with an idea. Anything totally whole-cloth will go here.

	Completed Sets in Phase 4:
		* Belle Epoche (Named after the french term for the era kind of around the Art Noveu period: Belle Époque...because the site I first found the term at spelled it wrong. >.< Sigh. I was going for the wrought iron feel of old bistro tables. They came about in this period... and as I also love Art Noveau...There's some of that in there too.)
		* The Cookie Blocks (A gingerbread house just in time for Christmas! I actually had the Handsel and Gretel witch in mind, but that's basically a winter story anyway...) 
		* The Pizza Blocks (Lydocia wanted pizza themed stuff...)
		* I've added the Gardening Set. This is for decorative farm paraphenalia. This is an "as I feel like it" set.

PHASE 5: Making Things Tidy -----------------------------[C5]

	This is all about me making the mod more useable and more immersive. When I started this project I barely knew what I was doing, I've got some other mods out now and some experience under my belt so I'm comfortable with spreading out to housekeeping items. 

	I've moved the Dock and Config files to their own folder. You can delete any "Set" folder without worrying about breaking stuff.
	I've added Lang files so wall shelves are now called shelves instead of wall mounted docks. 
	I've added patches so the totems will accept all bookshelves and TV stands. 
	There are patches for better integration with pets. 
	I've normalized most of the furniture prices.
	There are patches for playing nicely with other mods.

An upcoming project in this category will be to make patch folders that will take many/most items out of the catalogue and put them into the game organically for those players who want better immersion. Don't worry! Going back to the free access catalogue version will be the work of deleting a folder or two. I want EF to be customizable for people's tastes.

Fence Guide  (READ THIS! I MEAN IT!) --------------------[FG]

Fences are extremely complicated under the hood and make extensive use of the AutoTile system. AutoTile unclutters your inventory, but comes with the limitation that there are probably a few configurations that are hard to make and a small few might be impossible. Just about any *reasonable* fence should be makeable, however. 

I've tested my fences extensively and with some effort I have yet to find a configuration I can't make. If you do find a configuration you can't make, please let me know.

All of my fences are prefaced with "EF" and you can use it as a search term. They will NOT interact with the vanilla fences at all. I recommend using one or the other, but not both. All EF fences interact with other EF fences as though they're the same fence. This could look weird and may make a few configurations involving proximate fences impossible. I considered it a small price to pay for flexible and expandable fences. If you're doing weird fence interactions then you might consider pulling out the occasional vanilla fence piece if you really get stuck.

I've re-used the vanilla fence art where I could, to save on resources, but a few had to be edited for positioning. 

Every Fence has a special variation for detailing. In the files they're all called "destroyed" but now that there are Lang files I've given them appropriate descriptors. Not all Variant fences actually look broken. Some simply look overgrown or have some other extra decorative element. Variant fences could in theory be used as stand-alone fences, but they're usually meant to be detail or accent pieces.

Some Fences have gates that are separate blocks. These have no autoTile sections and don't interact with the logic at all. More gates are planned at some point when I'm not sick of looking at the fences. (I'm still sick of them!)

I don't presently intend to make Gates for the Wooden Pole Fences or the Rough Wooden Fence. Zallieh has done those: 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1300044927
Requests might make me change my mind.

All EF fences come with the following pieces or sub-pieces:
	
	* End - connects to one other fence tile. 
		* It can only be placed when three of the surrounding four tiles are empty air. This tile is new and has been added to every fence.
		* All "Destroyed" End tiles are actually meant to be stand alone fence posts that can be used with the "Normal" fence without any sign of destruction or decay. 
	* Straight - This piece was in every vanilla fence. It's a fence post in the center with two connections in a straight line. If this piece got new art it's likely because there was a positioning issue or graphical bug.
		* This piece will be placed by default if you manage to create a situation that makes every other piece invalid.
		* Being adjacent to a Corner, Middle, or End piece will let you place these.
	* Middle - This piece was only present in the stone pillar fence and the Wooden Pole fence. It's a straight connector without a fence post. If removing a post wasn't suitable for the fence I used it as a decorative embelishment piece. All M sections are technically "floating" and MUST be attached to a different fence piece or a wall or something. Even if it looks like they could stand on their own, they won't.
		* Being adjacent to a Corner, or Straight piece will let you place these.
		* You can place a long string of these, but they're really designed for being placed between Straight pieces.
		* If the fence has a Middle and Middle2 piece then the "Middle" piece will be directional and the "Middle2" will be flippable.
		
	* Corner - This piece was in every vanilla fence. You know what a corner is. If this piece got new art it's likely because there was a positioning issue or graphical bug.
		* Being adjacent to a Corner, or Straight piece will let you place these.
	* T Section - Three connection points.
		* If Three pieces of the fence surround the targeted block this piece will be available. You'll often have to go back and knock out a previously placed block to place this.
	* Cross - Four connection points.
		* If four pieces of the fence surround the targeted block this piece will be available. You'll often have to go back and knock out a previously placed block to place this.

How To Get Cool Patterns-----------------------------------------[CP]

 There are three patterns you can make easily with the fences on a straight stretch. It may take a little getting used to, though.

 If you place a Straight Piece, you'll be prompted to next place a Middle Piece and vice versa: SMSMSMSMSMSMS. This is the default pattern and takes no effort. Just never rotate the tiles.

All Straights is the standard pattern for the default farm fence: SSSSSSSS. To get this pattern place an M piece just before you want your straight pattern to start (You can knock it out later and replace it with a corner or something.) ROTATE TWICE. You'll now be placing a straight piece that will look identical to the other straight piece, but it will always drop another straight piece: MSSSSS.  

The MMMMMM Pattern is done just the same as the SSSSS pattern but you start the sequence with an S and then ROTATE TWICE. 

You're not locked into one pattern or the other, you can flip between them at will to create something like this: SMMSSMMSSMMMSSSMMMSSSMSSSSMSSSSM. 

Take note that the M section has (usually) been designed as a decorative accent. Some M sections (Especially on the Rope Fence) will not play well visually with themselves. The MMMM pattern won't look good for all fences.

The Stone Fence has and extra directional middle piece. It can make loads of patterns. (See the steam page for images.) Because of the added complexity there's no good way to instruct you to get every pattern.

S>MMMMM<S is the vanilla game pattern and should be fairly easy to achieve if you're comfortable with the simpler fences. 

The one pattern you can't make with just the tall Stone Fence is SMSMSMSMSMS. To make this you'll want to make SSSSS and then knock out every other block to get S_S_S. Then you'll need to swap to the Short Stone Fence and fill in the holes SmSmS. The M blocks between the two fences are virtually identical, but small chips have been removed from the base of the Short Stone Fence's medium tile so you can distinguish them and troubleshoot any issues.

Good luck! I find S>MsM<S to be particularly nice. 

EF Fence List and Notes----------------------------------------[FL]

Every EF Fence System comes with at least 2 blocks you can order. These blocks are usually normal and variant (destroyed, shaggy, flowered, etc.) versions of the fences. A fence will recognize any EF fence, but will ignore vanilla fences. 

	* Antique Fence (2 Blocks) - An old, shabby fence that still has some elegance. Expanded from Vanilla. 
		* The original vanilla Fence is single sided. There was no good way to make it play well with auto tile. It feels much lighter and thinner than mine due to auto tile limitations. You can play with the original perfectly well.
	* Black Fence (2 Blocks) - A wrought iron fence. Expanded from Vanilla. 
	* Bridge Fence (2 Blocks) - A fence designed to match the bridge tiles. New.
	* Dungeon Railing (2 Blocks) - A small stone railing. Vastly expanded and adapted from the Vanilla pieces.
		* Highly recommend you ignore the vanilla pieces this fence was based on, they do not play well with anything including each other.
	* Gingerbread Fence (2 Blocks) - A Christmasy fence made from sweets. Vastly expanded and adapted from vanilla. (The original fence only had the straight tile!)
	* Hedge (2 Blocks) - A tall hedge. Expanded from Vanilla.
	* Mushroom Maze Wall (2 Blocks) - Walls of the mushroom maze. Expanded from vanilla, and some revisions made to the spots on the top cap so they actually tile properly.
	* Picket Fence (2 Blocks) - A double sided white picket fence. Expanded and heavily modified from the vanilla "Fence".
		* The original vanilla Fence is single sided. There was no good way to make it play well with auto tile. It's the only vanilla fence I still recommend playing with if you like the look of it. My picket fence is more of an interpretation than anything else.
	* Rope Fence (2 Blocks) - A rope fence. Expanded from Vanilla.
	* Rough Wooden Fence (2 Blocks) - A sloppy wood fence, badly put together. Expanded from Vanilla. Designed to look sloppy and messy, so asymmetry was deliberately left in. The original pieces of the fence needed repositioning. 
	* Small Hedge (2 Blocks) - A short hedge.  Expanded from Vanilla.
	* Small Wooden Pole Fence (2 Blocks) - The default farm fence. Expanded from Vanilla.
	* Stone Fence (4 Blocks) - VERY ADVANCED FENCE. MASTER THE OTHERS FIRST! I'M NOT JOKING. The town square fence. Expanded from Vanilla. The taller version has an extra middle piece. The short version behaves like most of the other fences.
		* You might find the loose vanilla pieces easier to work with, but you should be able to make anything you like with the EF System. See [CP] for more info on this fence's features.
	* White Farm Fence (4 Blocks + Gate) - Vanilla had the gate, but no fence to go with it. Vastly expanded. It comes in two variations: Arch and Flat. They can be mixed and matched. The gate is still a separate piece and has no special autoTile functions.
	* Wooden Decking Railing (2 Blocks) - The railing in front of your starter house. Expanded from Vanilla.
	* Wooden Pole Fence (2 Blocks) - a lighter, taller version of the small wooden pole fence. Expanded from Vanilla.

For Modders:-------------------------------------------[MD]

(New as of 2.5) Town totems have now been almost totally genericized. You can make your mod dependent on Expanded Furniture to make use of this in your own mod, you can copy the "VanillaTotemPatches" folder and just change the priorities so there are no conflicts between your patches and EF, or you can just include the keywords on your own furniture and they'll work if a compatible mod has installed the totem patches. The full list of created generic categories is below (Copy paste these as-is to be safe.):	
	"Bookshelf",
	"TvStand", (DO NOT put "television", on this object unless it actually has a real TV on it too.)
	"Bathtub",
	"Shower", (Unused in vanilla, but it seemed the sort of thing to add now that there is one.)
	"BathroomSink",
	"sink", (Unused in the totem patches but available in case you don't care what kind of sink is used.)
	"Toilet",
	"counter", (Standard vanilla tag given to the tavern instead of the impossible to find No Dock counter.)
	"KitchenSink",
	"OfficeChair",
	"FilingCabinet",
	"ToiletPaper",
	"television", (ONLY apply this keyword to TVs. This keyword has been REMOVED from the TV Stand)

Note: If your user might have AutoMagic they need to be aware that the vanilla "Storage Bookshelf" is the only shelf that will work in the building store.

(New as of 2.2) The EF fence system is genericized. Fences check for category tags rather than specific tile codes. If you're a modder you can use the EF system for yourself and your fences will interact with mine. 

Make sure every tile file gets the appropriate tag: 

	"EFEnd"
	"EFCorner"
	"EFCross"
	"EFStraight"
	"EFMiddle"
	"EFTSection"

This assumes you're using a basic EF fence like the "Black Fence" or the "Stone Fence Short".

The more complicated "Stone Fence" (NOT THE SHORT ONE) has different logic and requires some additional tagging.

The Middle piece (which is directional and lives between the post and the middle section) should be tagged "EFMiddle1" AND "EFMiddle".

Middle2 (the part that actually behaves like the standard middle piece) should be tagged "EFMiddle2" AND "EFMiddle".


Known Bugs or Not Actual Issues ---------------------------[KB]

	* Some Futon docks might need work.
	* Add more docks to large wicker table? (Unsure. It's really big.)
	* The Paw set has swapped the Chair and the Stool.
	* The Simply Set has swapped the Loveseat with the Sofa.
	* The Simply Set has swapped the Side Table and the Coffee Table.
	* The Mushroom set has swapped the Chair and the Stool.
	* The Farm set has swapped the Chair and the Stool.
	* End pieces of fences (they only connect to one other piece) can only be placed when there are three empty blocks on their four sides. This is working as intended.


Corrected Art ----------------------------------------------[CA]

(As of 2.5) This category is mostly deprecated. The devs have made the majority of these fixes or something similar to them. These remain for historical purposes and as a backup incase some of the unused/changed art ever gets deleted.

Vanilla Staxel has a few rare graphical bugs. Most of these you will never notice, but they bothered me. Sadly we can't patch tiles, so I can't write a patch to apply these art corrections for you.

NONE OF THESE ARE REQUIRED OR NECESSARY. You can enjoy this mod without these fixes and odds are you've never even noticed any of these small details.

If you want to use the corrected models navigate to your installed mod folder. It should be something like:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Staxel\content\mods\ExpandedFurniture\

You'll find a folder here called "staxel" (lower case.) Copy/paste this folder to your equivalent folder to this: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Staxel\content\

and overwrite when prompted. You'll have to tell the modmanager to RUN THE CONTENT BUILDER. You'll have to do this every time you update Staxel or verify the integrity of your game files in steam.


Permissions -----------------------------------------------[PM]

Any assets I've created (basically anything in this mod barring simple corrections) do not require permission to use or change, barring any limitations on game assets themselves by the devs. Just don't take them wholecloth and call them yours. Credit is not required but appreciated. 

Dock files, AutoTile data, or any Bone Animations in particular are shared freely with the community in the hopes that more people make awesome things.

IN PARTICULAR: PLEASE **DO** STEAL AND USE THE "VanillaTotemPatches" FOLDER FOR USE IN YOUR OWN MODS AND USE THE TAGS MENTIONED IN THE MODDING SECTION. I don't require credit. Widespread community adoption of standards everyone can use is much more important to me than credit.

If you want to do any edits to the rainbow furniture in particular I recommend starting with the Grey set as your base. the colors are easiest to see there and the base color of the furniture doesn't conflict with the stripes.

Change History --------------------------------------------[CH]

Version 3.1
	* Ranch Bathroom set added. (Contains 12 new pieces of art, 12 new items total.)
	* Ranch Bathtubs and Shower can act as either stand alone pieces or will properly alcove to all reasonably sized blocks.

Version 3.01 (Unreleased)
	* Added a larger version of the Clock Tower Face to the Misc pack for people who have an odd sized space. It's 5x5.
	* fixed an art error in the Mushroom Bonsai garden.

Version 3.0
	* Broke EF into the base mod (this one) and a LOT of content packs.
	* Retained Paw Set.
	* Retained all Bookshelves so your stuff doesn't get dumped on the floor if you decide not to install some content packs.
	* Retained all Wallshelves so your stuff doesn't get dumped on the floor if you decide not to install some content packs.

Version 2.5.01
	* Moved structures into the cookieblocks folder so that it's easier for people who want to remove stuff.
	* Tweaked patches for Ship in a Bottle and MiniWagon so that they don't conflict with Rebuyable Rewards.
	* Fixed all the instances of lucky box tagging.

Version 2.5
	* Fixed minor art errors on the Spooky End tables and on the Spooky Silver Armchair.
	* Fixed Paw Futon Docks.
	* Added Antique Set. (I'm counting the window seat as the futon.) Prices are irregular as this can function as another starter set. (10 new pieces of art, 3 modifications, 2 animated pieces of art, 16 new items total.)
	* Added EF Antique normal and destroyed fences. Highly adapted from the vanilla set. (12 "new" pieces of art, 1 fence system, 2 new items total.)

	* Added Lang file for new Antique Furniture.
	* Added No Dock Version of the dining tables to all sets, and appropriate lang file entries.
	* Dockless versions of the rewards in the completed spoiler sets have been added. You can still *only* get the actual rewards from the characters. If the set isn't done you can only get the reward table.
	* Miniwagon, Eris cobwebs, Ship in a bottle, Skateboard Prop are all patched to be buyable and sellable if you unlock them.
	* Harvest festival trophy can be found in lucky boxes if not otherwise obtained. 
	* Fixed small graphical error on victorian wardrobe single.
	* Adjusted Sequioa wood now that the devs verified which version of sequoia was the intended version. 
	* Fully genericized town totem requirements.
	* Updated Bookshelf and TvStand Patches to modern standards. The game should only try to apply them if a mod exists.
	* Automagic is automatically detected and will use the correct Building Store totem requirements!
	* The Red stone block was changed to be a slightly deeper red following the Hideaway Hollow expansion. The old version of the red stone block is in the corrected art folder as RedStone_Old.qb if you care for it.
	* Pet compatability patches have been added. The pet patches will play nicely with Basic Staples, Automagic, and Xable's Animals. All the mods should be automatically detected! 
	* Added OAT and TAO pieces for the Slate Roof along with some variations on the Full roof block for decorative purposes on flat surfaces. (27 new pieces of art, 5 new items total.)
	* Dockless Coffee Tables cannot have anything set on top of them. They've also been DEPRECATED. They're pointless because you really can't set anything on them in the first place. It's too short. They will no longer appear in the catalog (Even the vanilla ones.) They still exist so if you're using them, you're fine. You just can't (easily) get new ones.
	* Fixed the Z depth of the Dockless Nerdy Coffee Table.	
	* Made the art of the Simply side table into a new, longer coffee table for the Simply Set. Adjusted the side table to be in line with the other side tables. (2 new pieces of art, 1 new item.)
	* Added Centered coffee table variations for both Loveseat and Sofa. Lang files corrected.
	* Surf Cotton is properly patched.
	* Added six more pet futons for six new pets. (6 new items, 6 new pieces of art).
	* Added the Gardening Set. 12 DECORATIVE seedling planter boxes (12 new items, 10 new pieces of art, 2 adapted pieces of art). The seedling planters do nothing but look pretty.

Version 2.4.2
	* Added patches so some shelves and TV stands from other mods are valid for furnishing requirements.

Version 2.4.1
	* Fixed art error on Brown Paw Chandelier.
	* Fixed error where vanilla bookshelf was not registering for totems.

Version 2.4
	* Added Catalogue Patches to make blocks you can't encounter available in the catalogue from the beginning and blocks you can encounter available once you find or inspect them.
	* Added two cobblestone block types to the Simply Set. This is art that was unused in the vanilla game. (2 new items total.) No idea how good it looks.
	* Pet patches have been added for all major pet mods. Each species of pet has a unique drop table. You can remove this feature by deleting "mods/ExpandedFurniture/PetPatches/SpeciesUniqueDrops"
	* Patches have been added to expand EF's furniture to Basic Staples. You can remove this feature by deleting "mods/ExpandedFurniture/PetPatches/BasicStaples"
	* A Furniture Shelf has been added to the petstore. You'll need to add another pet shelf to the store. You can remove this feature by deleting "mods/ExpandedFurniture/PetPatches/PetStoreFurnitureShelf"
	* A patch has been added to make Pets gift you all the EF pet furniture. This will only come into play if SpeciesUniqueDrops is deleted.
	* A patch folder has been added removing pet furniture from the catalog. You can remove this feature by deleting "mods/ExpandedFurniture/PetPatches/RemovePetFurnitureFromCatalog"
	* Added carpets for every set. Most get 1, Nerdy gets 4, Simply gets 2. (33 new pieces of art, 4 recolors, 33 new items total.)
	* Removed the Checkers Tablecloth because it's ugly and pointless now. I found a better solution for TV stands. (It's still *THERE* it's just not searchable or buyable or anything. You can go in and edit the file if you really want it back.)
	* Added totem patches so EF furniture satisfies house requirements unless they're calling for an item from a named set (like pastel)! Quantities have not changed so if they want 3 bookshelves you'll still have to give them 3, but they can be any mix of 3 that you like. Currently Bookshelves and TV Stands are now generalized. 
	* Regularized Pricing. All furniture sets (with the exception of Simply) have been adjusted so that all items cost the same to purchase as the others in the set. Yes, the prices are still insane. I've gone with Vanilla pricing schemes for everything. Vanilla had a handful of outliers so I've included those in a patch folder.
		* The Simply set is intended to be the starter set and as such doesn't have regularized prices, but almost all pieces cost less than 500p.
		* The Fey set has one exception. I've added a patch that reduces the price of the Glass Table to the same as everything else in the set and increased the sale price of the Wall Lamp. If you do a full loot and sell of everything inside the Fey manor you should recieve essentially the same amount of money as you did with the Vanilla prices. (I rounded up so you should get a few petals more.) The Devs clearly thought that the current amount of cash is an acceptable boost to your bank account but bringing the wall lamps up would have been too much. I've just made the wall lamp prices not so obscenely low.
	* Lang files! Everything is named!
	* The following objects had their codes changed just to avoid possible conflicts. (Sorry, you'll have to replace any instances of these! I try to avoid doing this but a couple slipped by.)
		* Spooky Candle Single (Spooky Candle 2)
		* Contemporary Coffee Table (No Dock)
		* Contemporary Double Bed (No Dock)
		* Contemporary Single Bed (No Dock)
		* White Farm Fence Gate.
	* Corrected an art error on Farm Single Bed.
	* Added scrollwork to the Pastel TV Stand.
	* Added the Wicker Chair. (The art's been done since I released it. Somehow I missed the .tile file!)
	* Gazebo Back Panel, White Garden Arch and White Gazebo added to Simply set. (1 new piece of art, 8 recolors, 9 new items total.)
	* Corrected microscopic art errors on Belle Epoche bookshelf, side table and wall dock.
	* Sequoia Wood art has been corrected and is in the patch folder. It will now tile properly if you install the corrected art folder.
	* Sequioa is now available in the simply set. This was probably a prototype of Sequoia wood with a different palette. It was misspelled and never caught. It's now useable!
	* Added color changing Chameleon Plush to the Rainbow Set. (12 new pieces of art, 1 new item total.)
	* I've moved any docks or configuration files to their own folders. If there's a set you don't like you can delete that folder without worry.

Version 2.3
	* TAO and OAT blocks implemented in every roof color and some additional roof colors added. (940 new pieces of art, 194 new items total...I'm so sorry....) 2:1 slopes are called TAO (Two Above One) blocks and 1:2 are OAT (One Above Two). Each of these blocks has a "base" end for the fat bit, and a "tip" end for the skinny bit. They should be applied in alternating layers. TAO blocks can be troublesome if you try you build down. For best results, build bottom up with TAO blocks.

Version 2.2
	* Added the Mushroom Maze to the Fence set because I somehow totally missed it. (12 "new" pieces of art, 1 fence system, 2 new items total.)
	* Added corrected art for the vanilla mushroom maze to the corrected art folder. The original spots didn't tile properly.
	* Added the "Little Cloud" to the Simply Set. This was created for the autoTile mod, but didn't work for the task I wanted to use it for, so I put it here, because it's cute. (1 new piece of art, 1 new item total.)
	* Added the "Sundial Kit" to the Fey Set. This was created for the autoTile mod, but I didn't want people to have to download that to get it. It was added to the Fey set because it's designed to match the pillars. (2 new pieces of art, 1 new item total.)
	* Added the "Deeper Mushroom" to the Mushroom Set. This was created for the autoTile mod, but I didn't want people to have to download that to get it. It was added to the Mushroom set because mushroom. (3 new pieces of art, 1 new item total.)
	* Revised the corrected Ivy tile from vanilla to now have all the features (3 new pieces of art, 0 new items) from the autoTile Tutorial. If ivy tiles are detected two blocks above or below the tile being placed a full 9 squares of ivy will be placed around the target block.
	* Added the Pizza Blocks Set (7 new pieces of art, 6 new items total.) This is just for fun, I have no plans to add more stuff to this.
	* All EF fences have been revised to take advantage of category tags. Each fence will now respond to any other EF fence as if they were one fence. If you're a modder, you can take advantage of the EF system just by adding the appropriate tags to your fence tiles and using one of the autoTile blobs in your own fence! See the fence section for details.
	* Any fence piece that is a multiple of a block height is now capable of having something put on it. (This is not universal for the entire fence. For example: the black fence is only valid if there's a tall knobbed post on the piece. I also fudged this a little. Some fences might be a voxel or two tall or short. Depending on the object you use this may or may not look ok.) Most fences have some blocks that can accept things on top of them, but a few still don't. This added 4 pieces of art to the small wooden pole fence because for some weird reason the vanilla fence is 2 blocks high but only 16 voxels tall.
	* Added Black Metal Set (30 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 34 new items total.)
	* I've added an easter egg. It has nothing to do with eggs or Easter. Baa.


Version 2.1 - Merry Christmas, and a Serene Snowdust!
	* Added the missing "cookie" tag to the gingerbread fence.
	* Added the cookie house as a random spawn on build.
	* Added the Cookie Blocks (87 new pieces of art, 2 roof sets, 3 walls, 2 flooring, 2 buildings, 33 new items total.)

	* To cut back on memory usage, the Gingerbread wall blocks have been slightly crippled. If you want the full art experience, you can open "Gingerbread01.tile" through "Gingerbread03.tile" and remove the commented lines and set the altCount to 9. I've selected what I thought was the best looking limited mix, but feel free to tweak to your taste.
	* The roof systems, have an additional block: The Ridge. The ridge is designed to go above the peak of the roof, right in the middle, in case you don't line up your roof properly and had to use a full block down the center. The Ridge and Flat tiles both have an unusual use of autoTile: Rotating will swap through four style options instead of changing the directionality of the block. This doesn't hurt anything since the tiles are effectively rotationally symmetric.

Version 2.0
	* Added the Fence Set (191 "new" pieces of art, 14 fence systems, 33 new items total.)
	* Added the Festival Set (7 new pieces of art, 4 new animated objects, 11 new items total.)
	* The festival set is mostly items from festivals that people want to use to decorate but are either unbreakable or cause problems because they're totems. There are also some variations on the snowdust lanterns and a clean version of the Pumpking fountain because someone asked.


Version 1.9
	* Added 7 items to the Simply set. Workbench, Ivy, Ripped Rubbish Bag, Smashed Bottle, Plastic Bag, Pumpkin, & Chimney Pipe Big. (Ivy had the art edited slightly to affect positioning a bit.) These are all Vanilla items that had no tile files, had display or positioning errors, or were Oscar Quest items that I thought would possibly be useful to players for decoration options. The art files that had no tile files associated with them have had the art backed up in the staxel folder in case the devs ever remove them. Should you ever get an error about missing art assets when running the content builder please see the "To Use Corrected Art Assets" section of this document.
	* Added Nerdy Set (86 new pieces of art, 15 new animated objects, 12 no dock variations, 98 new items total.)

Version 1.8
	* Corrected an error in the Checkers TV Stand
	* Added Groovy Set (19 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 24 new items total.)
	* Added Victorian Set (17 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 4 no dock variations, 21 new items total.)
	* Added Fey Set (28 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 4 variant objects, 7 no dock variations, 32 new items total.)
	* The Fey Credenza exists in the game files as "Daisy Drawers." In vanilla it's only accessible via creative.
	* The Flower Glass Table is the desk for the Fey set.
	* The Fey set has three side tables for some crazy reason.
	* All Chandeliers revised to 3x3 to center properly.
	* Added a corrected version of the Spooky Candles called "Spooky Candles Full" (There was nothing wrong with the art. The tops of the candles are cut off by the .tile file, so I can't just drop corrected art into the corrections folder.)
	* Added a single candle version to the Spooky Set.
	

Version 1.7
	* Added Pastel Set (15 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 20 new items total.)
	* Added Belle Epoche Set (33 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 38 new items total.)
	* The Belle Epoche Set started as a variation of the Pastel set, but eventually just became it's own thing. It's designed to mix and match well with the Pastel set.


Version 1.6
	* Added Minimalist Set (18 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 4 no dock variations, 22 new items total.)
	* Added Farm Set (32 new pieces of art, 3 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 37 new items total.)
	* Added Ranch Set (20 new pieces of art, 4 new animated objects, 1 no dock variations, 21 new items total.)
	* There is art for the Farm side table in the game files, but no tile file for it. It's merely a white placeholder marked with "WIP", totally unsuited to the set in every respect. I'm treating it as though it's not even there.
	* The Tractor bed is in the art files for the farm set, but the QB called by staxel for the farm set is actually the Ranch bed. (Likely because the tractor bed became a quest item.) For my purposes this is an error and I'm treating the tractor bed as the true farm set piece. 


Version 1.5
	* Added two more futons to the Pet Set so you can pick the themed choice of your favorite pet. Added a second Chandelier to the Pet Set. (3 new pieces of art, 3 new items total.)
	* Added Mushroom Set (58 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 63 new items total.)
	* The mushroom bonsai garden has every mushroom in the game planted in little pots for your decorating pleasure.
	* Added Darkwood Set (25 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 30 new items total.)
	* Darkwood Futon Pillow is a Chocolate Cake pillow. The Darkwood set was originally a reward set apparently intended to be gifted to you by Emilia. This is the first of the Reward Sets.


Version 1.4
	* Added the Pet Set (24 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 29 new items total.)
	* Added the Simply Set (69 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 color variants for 10 items, 5 no dock variations for 5 colors, 1 additional no dock variation, 82 new items total.)
	* Pillow was deliberately excluded from the Simply Futon.

Version 1.3
	* Added two more plants to the Wicker Set. (2 new pieces of art. 2 new items total.)
	* Added Contemporary Set (15 new pieces of art, 3 new animated objects, 3 no dock variations, 18 new items total.)
	* Added Checkers Set (12 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 5 no dock variations, 17 new items total.)



Version 1.2
	* Added Rainbow Sets (25 new pieces of art for each of 7 color variations, 2 new animated objects for 7 color variations, 5 no dock variations for 7 color variations, 210 new items total.)
	* There are three new variations to the rainbow set: Black, White, and Coffee. (34 new pieces of art for each of 3 color variations, 2 new animated objects for 3 color variations, 5 no dock variations for 3 color variations, 117 new items total.)
	* Added Multicolor Rainbow items. (12 new pieces of art, 2 new animated objects, 12 items total added.) These are NOT meant to be a full set, but are meant to be additional accessories shared among all the rainbow sets just like the original rainbow lamp is. That said, there is one piece of furniture that was done as a test and has been added here. If I get enough requests I might actually turn this into a full set someday.
	*Adjusted Wicker and Spooky Chandeliers to be 3x2x3 so they center better.

Version 1.1
	* Added Wicker Set (27 new pieces of art, 1 new animated object, 5 no dock variantions, 31 new items total)
	* I count the Tiki Torch as a "candle" for the wicker set's purposes.
	* Added Spooky Haunted Vanity (1 new animated object, 1 new item total)
	* Added Spooky Silver Haunted Vanity (1 new animated object, 1 new item total)

Version 1.0
	* Added Spooky Set (40 new pieces of art, 2 color variants for 14 items, 8 no dock variantions, 52 new items total)
	* Note: I consider the purple and orange candles, and any halloween objects to be valid members of the spooky set. Both of the skulls and the skull candles also live in the spooky folder so they count as well. Basically every candle the game shipped with belongs to this set.
